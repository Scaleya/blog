# Support me for free! ðŸ’°

Hey! The mere fact that you are here is an achievement for me! Thank you so much! Here, have an ad:

{{< amp-adsense
    width="320"
    height="320"
    layout="fixed"
    slot="9425131909" >}}

I don't **normally** use ads on my blog, so if you like my content, find it useful or amusing you may like some of the ways you can support me listed below! You don't need to spend a dime!

## Referral links and affiliate marketing

This is my favorite option by far, I recommend products that I use and love and it helps me keep the content coming:

I only list products that I'm using so take a look, they are all worth it:

- <a href="https://amzn.to/33GCvRh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >Amazon</a>: No introduction needed. If you buy anything less than 24 hours after clicking the link Amazon will give me between 3 and 7% of the amount you spent with no extra cost for you.
- <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=ca90aa0a45540066ec753ff02b33a332d566e243" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >Linode</a>: One of the best cloud providers I know, with a really simple billing system and very competitive prices, is a no brainer. $5 a month for a 1GB VPS? I mean, c'mon!
- <a href="https://brave.com/asu769" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >Brave Browser</a>: This is a project I love. Brave is an internet browser where you control the number of ads you see per hour. Not only that, but they give you 70% of those ads revenue in form of BATs (Basic attention tokens), which you can donate to your favorite creators. If you install it and use it for a month Brave will donate me $5 in BATs.
- <a href="https://n26.com/r/asurb2865" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >N26 Bank</a>: This is my bank of choice. They have GPay and Apple Pay, you can withdraw money five times a month from anywhere in the world and it's 100% free. If you sign up we both get 15â‚¬ (Europe only).
- <a href="https://www.degiro.es/amigo-invita-amigo/empezar-a-invertir.html?id=AF7738F9&referral_name=Asur%20Bernardo%20Fern%C3%A1ndez&utm_source=mgm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >DeGiro Broker</a>: This broker has 60 industry prices at is back and it's the best option for Europe. If you sign up you will get 20â‚¬ in commissions, if you spend them I will get 20â‚¬ myself. This is for Europe only, of you are from the US stick to Robinhood or M1 Finance, you are lucky to have those options!

## Donations

The best thing to do in these cases is to use crypto, I use **Monero** because of its privacy features and low fees. This is my wallet:

```

If you use Brave Browser you can also donate some BATs to this site clicking on the Brave logo at the right of the URL box.

If you are sure you want to spend money (which I wouldn't recommend) this is my <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZPEPDV2UMSUYS&source=url" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paypal</a>.
